# Simulation-Based Design and Analysis of a Vent Cleaning Robot

**Research Project | Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka**

## Project Overview

Air ducts in HVAC systems require regular cleaning to maintain airflow, energy efficiency, and healthy indoor air quality. Accumulated dust, debris, and clogs reduce efficiency and pose health risks such as allergies and respiratory problems.  

This project presents a **vent cleaning robot** designed to navigate ducts, break dust clumps, and assist vacuum cleaning. The robot combines lightweight aluminum alloy construction, a wheel-track locomotion system, rotating brushes, and a sensor module for autonomous navigation and cleaning.  

A **3D model** was built in SolidWorks, and **Simulink simulations** validated the operational dynamics of the robot and sensor modules.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Cleaning:** Robot can identify clogs and dust clusters in air ducts and clean them efficiently.  
- **Mobility:** Wheel-track system made of polyurethane for stable movement on dusty or slippery surfaces, including vertical ducts.  
- **Rotary Brush:** Effectively scrubs duct surfaces to dislodge accumulated dust.  
- **Sensor Module:** Includes ultrasonic sensors and camera modules to detect obstacles, clogs, and monitor cleaning progress.  
- **Control System:** Provides precise navigation, brush actuation, and integration with simulation models for testing and validation.
